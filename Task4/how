We Implemented the molecule Task using linear_sum_assignment
from scipy.optimize witch directly implements the Hungarian algorithm and gave really good results. The aproach
is that we first translate all gxl
files into python objects containing all the needed information, since we use them different times. It took a while to understand how to use gx
l-files( but now it's nice to know). Creating the Dirac matrix worked as in the lecture
and the documentation for the algorithm of scipy
explained how to handle the results to calculate ged.
Then we simply iterate though both sets and calculated the distance matrix and used knn
as in exercise 1. We tried to optimize the parameters Ce,Cn
and k.  Cn and Ce = 1 and k = 3 gave good results and more testing didn't bring better results
so that was quite useless.
